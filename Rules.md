## Magic Missile

Hit Location is determined by reversing the dice rolled \
**Damage**: **SL** + **WPB** (Willpower Bonus) + spell’s listed Damage

## Touch Spells in Combat

Make an **Opposed Melee (Brawling)** Test (generally opposed by
the **Melee** or **Dodge** Skill) after completing the Casting Test.

If you do this and your spell was a [Magic Missile](#magic-missile),
the **Melee (Brawling)** Test is used to determine Hit Location struck,
**not** the **Language (Magick)** Test.

## Interruptions

Receiving damage or taking a Surprised Condition counts as interruption

- Pass a **Hard (–20) Cool** Test or
- Lose all channeled **SL**
- Roll [Minor Miscast Table](#minor-miscast-table)

## Ingredients

- **Ingredients are spell specific**.
- Write them down as: _ingredient_ (_name of the spell_).
- Ingredients are removed from inventory upon casting s spell

Effect of an ingredient:

- A Major Miscast may be reduced to a Minor one.
- A Minor Miscast may be reduced to no effect.
- **Must** be used for Hedgecraft spells

### Ingredients cost

| Cost | Lore |
| ------------- | -------------- |
| **CN** Brass pennies | Witchcraft |
| 5 Brass pennies | Hedgecraft |
| **CN** Silver shillings | Other |

### Ingredient foraging

Witches and Hedgewitches can forage for their ingredients

- **Witchcraft**: Outdoor survival -> 1 + **SL** ingredients
- **Hedgecraft**: Lore (Herbalism) -> 1 + **SL** ingredients

### Ingredient Types

| Ingredients | Lore |
| ------------- | -------------- |
| animal body parts and organs | Witchcraft |
| herbs or plants | Hedgecraft |
<!-- TODO: Fill with other ingredients -->

## Advantage and magic

Advantage in combat applies to **casting tests**, not channelling
tests.

If a target already had a spell from the same Lore
cast on it that round, a new spellcaster gains **+1 Advantage**.

## Repelling the winds

Wearing armour makes spells harder to cast

- **Recieve**: -1 **SL** x location with most armour points
- **Magic (Metal)**: Can wear metal armour
- **Magic (Beasts)**: Can wear leather armour

## Dispelling

- **Range**: Willpower yards
- **Roll**: Opposed Language (Magic)
  - **Win** spell is dispelled
  - **Lose** the spell continues as normal

### Dispelling Persistent Spells

Make **Extended Language (Magick)** when **SL** reaches spell's **CN** it is dispelled

- Dispelling your own spell you get **+1 Advantage**.
- **Multiple** spellcasters, dispelling **with different Lore** make Tests **separately**
- Using the **same Lore** make an **Assisted Test**

## Warpstone

- **Double** the **SL** when Casting and Channelling
- 1 gram of warpstone typically supplies 20 **CN** worth of magical energy.
- Suffer Major Exposure

### Major Exposure

**Roll**: **Challenging (+0) Endurance** Test

| **SL** | Corruption points |
| ------------- | -------------- |
| Failed | 3 |
| 0-1 | 2 |
| 2-3 | 1 |
| 2-3 | 1 |
| 4+ | 0 |

## Overcasting

For every +2 **SL** above **CN** you may increase:
Range, Area of Effect, Duration, Targets

**With formula**: **Bonus SL**/2 x value

## Grimoire

Casting a spell from grimoire **Doubles** the **CN**
and uses both hands

- Transcribing a spell or ritual into a grimoire takes 1 hour plus 1 hour per **CN**.

- A successful **Challenging (+0) Art(Writing)** Test,
may reduce the time by 1 hour per **SL**,
but failure means the wizard must start again.

- A non-wizard can copy a spell with a successful **Extended Difficult (–10)
Art(Writing)** Test to a total of 5 **SL** per **CN**.
The process also takes 1 hour plus 1 hour per **CN**
