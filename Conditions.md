## Master Condition list

### Ablaze

> You are on fire! This Condition is normally only applied if you are
flammable — for example: wearing clothes that can be set alight
— but some magical and divine effects can set you alight even if
you are not normally combustible!

> At the end of every Round, you suffer 1d10 Wounds, modified by
Toughness Bonus and the Armour Points on the least protected
Hit Location, with a minimum of 1 Wound suffered. Each extra
[_Ablaze_](#ablaze) Condition you have adds +1 to the Damage suffered so, three [_Ablaze_](#ablaze) Conditions result in 1d10+2 Damage suffered.

**Interval:**  At the end of every round \
**Damage:** 1d10 + (Amount of [_Ablaze_](#ablaze) conditions -1 )\
**Remove:**  **Challenging (+0) Athletics** Test, each additional **SL** removes one extra [_Ablaze_](#ablaze) Condition.

> The Difficulty for this Test is modified by circumstances: it’s much
easier to put out a fire rolling around on sand than it is in the
middle of an oil-soaked kitchen.

### Bleeding

> You are bleeding badly.
Lose blood the end of every Round.
Further, if you reach 0 Wounds,
you no longer lose Wounds and instead fall immediately unconscious
and have a chance to **die** from blood loss.

**Interval:** At the end of Round \
**Damage**: 1 x (Amount of bleeding conditions) ignoring all modifiers

**Remove:**
- **Challenging (+0)  Heal** Test, with each **SL** removing an extra Bleeding Condition
- Spell or prayer that heals Wounds, with one Condition removed per Wound healed

**Effects:**
- Suffer a penalty of **–10 to _any_ Tests** to resist _Festering Wounds_,
_Minor Infection_, or _Blood Rot_ (see page 186)
- When you have 0 Wounds gain _Unconscious_ Condition
  - At the end of the rund **Roll:** 1d100
    - 0 - (Amount of _Bleeding_ conditions * 10) you die
    - **Double** removes one _Bleeding_ Condition
    - You cannot regain consciousness until all _Bleeding_ Conditions
  are removed (see Injury on page 172)
- Once all Bleeding Conditions are removed, gain one _Fatigued_ Condition
