## Master Condition list

### Ablaze

> You are on fire! This Condition is normally only applied if you are
flammable — for example: wearing clothes that can be set alight
— but some magical and divine effects can set you alight even if
you are not normally combustible!

> At the end of every Round, you suffer 1d10 Wounds, modified by
Toughness Bonus and the Armour Points on the least protected
Hit Location, with a minimum of 1 Wound suffered. Each extra
[_Ablaze_](#ablaze) Condition you have adds +1 to the Damage suffered so, three [_Ablaze_](#ablaze) Conditions result in 1d10+2 Damage suffered.

**Interval:**  At the end of every round \
**Damage:** 1d10 + (Amount of [_Ablaze_](#ablaze) conditions -1 ) \
**Remove:**  **Challenging (+0) Athletics** Test, each additional **SL** removes one extra [_Ablaze_](#ablaze) Condition.

> The Difficulty for this Test is modified by circumstances: it’s much
easier to put out a fire rolling around on sand than it is in the
middle of an oil-soaked kitchen.

### Bleeding

> You are bleeding badly.
Lose blood the end of every Round.
Further, if you reach 0 Wounds,
you no longer lose Wounds and instead fall immediately unconscious
and have a chance to **die** from blood loss.

**Interval:** At the end of Round \
**Damage**: 1 x (Amount of bleeding conditions) ignoring all modifiers

**Remove:**
- **Challenging (+0)  Heal** Test, with each **SL** removing an extra Bleeding Condition
- Spell or prayer that heals Wounds, with one Condition removed per Wound healed

**Effects:**
- Suffer a penalty of **–10 to _any_ Tests** to resist _Festering Wounds_,
_Minor Infection_, or _Blood Rot_ (see page 186)
- When you have 0 Wounds gain _Unconscious_ Condition
  - At the end of the rund **Roll:** 1d100
    - 0 - (Amount of _Bleeding_ conditions * 10) you die
    - **Double** removes one _Bleeding_ Condition
    - You cannot regain consciousness until all _Bleeding_ Conditions
  are removed (see Injury on page 172)
- Once all Bleeding Conditions are removed, gain one [_Fatigued_](#fatigued) Condition

### Blinded
> Perhaps because of a flash of light, or because of liquid sprayed in
your face, you are unable to see properly

**Remove:** One At the end of every round \
**Effects:**
- **–10** penalty to _all_ Tests involving **sight**
- Opponent attacking you in close combat gains a bonus of **+10** to hit you

### Broken
> You are terrified, defeated, panicked, or otherwise convinced you
are going to die. On your turn, your Move and Action must be
used to run away as fast as possible until you are in a good hiding
place beyond the sight of any enemy; then you can use your
Action on a Skill that allows you to hide more effectively. You
also receive a penalty of –10 to all Tests not involving running
and hiding.
You cannot Test to rally from being Broken if you are Engaged
with an enemy (see page 159). If you are unengaged, at the end
of each Round, you may attempt a Cool Test to remove a Broken
Condition, with each SL removing an extra 
Broken Condition,
and the Difficulty determined by the circumstances you currently
find yourself: it is much easier to rally when hiding behind a barrel
down an alleyway far from danger (Average +20) than it is when
three steps from a slavering Daemon screaming for your blood
(Very Hard –30). If you spend a full Round in hiding out of line-of-sight of any
enemy, you remove 1 Broken Condition.
Once all Broken Conditions are removed, gain 1 [_Fatigued_](#fatigued) Condition.

### Deafened

> Whether caused by a loud noise or a blow to the head, you are
unable to hear properly. 

**Remove:** One At the end of every round \
**Effects:**
- **–10** penalty to _all_ Tests involving **hearing**
- Opponent attacking you in close combat from the **flank** or **rear** gains a bonus of **+10** to hit you

### Entangled

> You are wrapped in something restricting your movement; it
could be ropes, spider’s webbing, or an opponent’s bulging biceps.

**Remove:** **Action** win an Opposed Strength Test against the source of
the entanglement, with each **SL** removing an extra Entangled Condition \
**Effects:**
- **you may not Move**
- **–10** penalty to _all_ Movement Tests

### Fatigued

> You are exhausted or stressed, and certainly in need of rest. 

**Effects:** **–10** penalty to _all_ Tests.

> Removing a Fatigued Condition normally requires rest,
a spell, or a divine effect, though in some instances, such as when a
Fatigued Condition is caused by carrying too much
(see Encumbrance on page 293), simply changing your
circumstances (carrying fewer trappings, for
example) can remove a Condition.

**Remove:** up to GM
- **Realistic:** remove a _Fatigue_ condition after a prolonged rest.
- **Timed:** require only an hour or so of rest for each _Fatigue_ condition
- **Fast and simple:** remove a _Fatigue_ condition per round of rest

>  It’s up to you and your group to decide how much rest you need

### Poisoned

### Prone

### Stunned

### Surprised

### Unconscious
